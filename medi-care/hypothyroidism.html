	<h2>HYPOTHYROIDISM </h2>
Definition Hypothyroidism	is	defined	as	the	hypofunction	of	thyroid	gland,	characterized	by	decreased	secretion	of	thyroxine	(T4)	and	triiodothyronine	(T3). It	is	of	2	types: 
<ul>
<li>•	Primary	hypothyroidism—means	cause	in	the	thyroid	gland.	It	is	usually	associated	with	myxoedema.</li> <li>•	Secondary	hypothyroidism—means	cause	in	the	pituitary	(or	rarely	hypothalamus).	In	such	case,	myxoedema	is	rare.	There	are	other	features	of	hypopituitarism	also. Causes of Primary Hypothyroidism</li>
<li> 1. Autoimmune:	– Spontaneous	atrophic	hypothyroidism	(commonest).	– Hashimoto’s	thyroiditis.	– Graves’	disease	(associated	with	TSH	receptor	blocking	antibody).</li>
<li> 2. Iatrogenic:	– Radioiodine	therapy	for	thyrotoxicosis.	– After	surgery	(thyroidectomy).	– Postradiotherapy	in	the	neck.	– Drugs—such	as	lithium,	amiodarone	and	antithyroid	drug. </li>
<li> 3. Others:	– Endemic	iodine	deficiency.	– Postpartum	thyroiditis.	– Rarely,	dyshormonogenesis. Causes of Goitrous Hypothyroidism</li>
<li> •	Hashimoto’s	thyroiditis.</li>
<li> •	Graves’	disease	(there	is	also	exophthalmos	and	diffuse	goitre	with	dermopathy).</li>
<li> •	Endemic	iodine	deficiency	(less	common).</li>
<li> •	Drugs—lithium,	amiodarone,	iodide.</li>
</ul>

<ul><h2>Clinical Features Symptoms</h2>
<li> •	Weight	gain	and	swelling	of	the	whole	body.</li>
<li> •	Cold	intolerance.</li>
<li>•	Increased	sleepiness,	lethargy,	anorexia	and	weakness.</li>
<li> •	Constipation.</li>
<li> •	Lack	of	concentration	and	poor	memory.</li>
<li> •	In	female,	menorrhagia. Signs</li>
<li> •	The	patient	looks	apathetic.</li>
<li> •	Whole	body	is	swollen.	Face	is	puffy	with	periorbital	swelling,	baggy	eyelids	and	loss	of	outer	1/3rd	of	the	eyebrows.</li>
<li> •	Nonpitting	oedema	(due	to	deposition	of	mucopoly	saccharide	substances). •	Skin	is	dry,	rough,	cold	and	thick.</li> 
<li>•	Pulse—bradycardia	(less	than	60/min).</li>
<li> •	BP—may	be	high.
</ul>

<h2>Treatment</h2>
<ul> <li>Thyroxine—started	with	low	dose	(25	μg),	increase	gradually	after	3	weeks.	Single	dose	is	preferable,	should	be	taken	before	breakfast.	TSH	should	be	repeated	after	6–8	weeks.	Once	TSH	is	normal,	maintenance	dose	should	be	continued.</li>
<li> Treatment of Hypothyroidism in Different Conditions 1.	Ischemic	heart	disease:	– Thyroxine	should	be	started	in	low	dose	(25	µg),	to	be	increased	slowly	up	to	the	optimum	dose.	– Beta-blocker	(propranolol)	should	be	added.	– Coronary	dilator,	calcium	antagonist	may	be	added.</li>
<li> 2.	In	elderly	patient	with	hypothyroidism:	Treatment	is	same.	But	care	should	be	taken	in	IHD.	Following	thyroxine,	it	may	precipitate	angina	and	myocardial	infarction.</li>
<li> 3.	Hypothyroidism	in	pregnancy:	– Most	sensitive	investigation	is	TSH,	which	is	high.	Also,	FT3	and	FT4	should	be	done	(total	T3	and	T4	may	be	high	in	normal	pregnancy	due	to	increased	TBG).	– Treatment—thyroxine	should	be	given	(100–150	µg	once	daily).	Requirement	of	thyroxine	is	relatively	high	(40–50%)	in	pregnancy.</li>
